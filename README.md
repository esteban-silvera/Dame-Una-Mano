###  The Story

The inspiration for our project came from a personal experience one of our team members had with plumbing issues in a small town where word of mouth is crucial for finding services. Despite reaching out to friends for recommendations, they were unable to connect with the recommended plumber who was on vacation at the time. Instead, they had to resort to contacting plumbers from a neighboring town, who charged a hefty fee for their services.

This incident stuck with us as we brainstormed ideas for a solution to a common problem many people face. We realized that there was a clear need in the Uruguayan market for a service-based app that could connect individuals with professionals. After brainstorming several names, we settled on "Dame Una Mano," which translates to "Give me a hand" â€“ a phrase commonly used when seeking assistance. This name resonated with us because it reflects the intention behind our project: to provide a platform where people can easily find professionals to help them with a wide range of issues, from home repairs like plumbing to car maintenance, while also contributing to the local economy. Our goal is to bridge the gap between individuals seeking services and professionals within their neighborhoods.

**Front End:**

- Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development
- Dart programming language for app logic
- Material Design for consistent UI styling
- API calls to interact with Firebase services

**Back End:**

- Firebase Firestore for real-time NoSQL database
- Firebase Storage for storing media files
- Google Maps API and Geocoding API for location services
- Google Cloud Platform for backend services and infrastructure support

**Server / Deployment:**

- Firebase Hosting for hosting the Flutter web app
- Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless functions
- Firebase Authentication for user authentication and authorization

This setup allows for a seamless integration of Flutter and Dart for the front end, Firebase and Google Cloud services for the back end, and Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions for server deployment and management.

**Challenges**

The challenges we encountered included dedicating ample time to understand the nuances of each new technology. To address this, we divided the team between front end and backend development. Our front end developers focused on crafting the application's aesthetic using tools like Figma and Flutter, ensuring it aligned with the project's concept. Meanwhile, the backend developers concentrated on building the database infrastructure using Firebase for hosting and integrating the Google Maps API for real-time user-professional connections. Throughout this process, we relied on task-based platforms such as Trello to track weekly objectives and ensure we met our deadline for completing the app.
