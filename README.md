**Challenges**

The challenges we encountered included dedicating ample time to understand the nuances of each new technology. To address this, we divided the team between front end and backend development. Our front end developers focused on crafting the application's aesthetic using tools like Figma and Flutter, ensuring it aligned with the project's concept. Meanwhile, the backend developers concentrated on building the database infrastructure using Firebase for hosting and integrating the Google Maps API for real-time user-professional connections. Throughout this process, we relied on task-based platforms such as Trello to track weekly objectives and ensure we met our deadline for completing the app.
